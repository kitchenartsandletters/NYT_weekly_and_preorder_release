✅ NYT Preorder & Weekly Report System – Refactor Specification (refactorSpec.init)

Overview

This system automates the tracking, approval, release, and reporting of preorder books sold via Shopify. It replaces a brittle file- and GitHub-driven system with a robust, database-backed workflow deployed to Railway.

⸻

🧱 Tech Stack
	•	Platform: Railway (for app deployment)
	•	Database: PostgreSQL (Railway-hosted)
	•	Primary Interfaces:
	•	Slack: Slash commands & modals for approvals and alerts
	•	(Optional in future): Web UI for audit trail, filtering, and history

🗃️ Phase 1: Database Structure

Tables and their purposes:

Table	Purpose
preorders	All products tagged ‘preorder’ from Shopify. Core metadata lives here.
presales	Each preorder line item sold (by order_id, ISBN, qty, date).
releases	Approved releases with presale snapshot and inventory.
anomalies	Logged validation errors and data mismatches.
audit_logs	Snapshots of batch jobs, imports, and warnings.
nyt_exports	Tracks which ISBNs were exported in a given weekly NYT report.

Full schema provided in schema.sql (foreign keys, types, timestamps aligned).

🧠 Phase 2: Modular Pipeline

Each of the following is a stateless function in /functions and can be called in sequence or individually for debugging or testing:

sync_preorders()        # Pull 'preorder' tagged products from Shopify
record_presales()       # Log order line items to presales via webhook
analyze_readiness()     # Identify preorder titles eligible for release
release_preorder(isbn)  # Unpublish, remove tags, insert into releases
log_anomalies()         # Detect malformed pub_date, tag, or collection state
export_nyt_report()     # Build NYT-compatible CSV using presales + releases

🔍 Preorder Lifecycle Rules

Preorder (Active)
	•	Tagged with 'preorder'
	•	In Preorder Collection (handle: 'pre-order')
	•	Pub date (metafield or tag) is in the future

Preorder (Historical)
	•	Tagged with 'preorder'
	•	Not in Preorder Collection
	•	Pub date is in the past

Preorder (Anomaly)
	•	Formatting errors in pub_date
	•	Missing or mismatched tags vs. metafield
	•	Structural data issues (e.g. missing ISBN, duplicate release)

Anomalies are logged to anomalies and surfaced via Slack and optional UI.

📅 Phase 3: Weekly NYT Report

Reporting Window:
	•	Sunday → Saturday (inclusive)
	•	Report is generated Monday AM

Inclusion Logic:

a. Released This Week
	•	Books with a pub_date falling within this week’s window
	•	Include:
	•	ISBN
	•	Presales total (prior to or on release date)

b. Post-Release Sales
	•	For titles released in prior weeks, include only if they sold copies this week
	•	Presales are not counted again
	•	Only net new sales (via Shopify orders)

Export Format (CSV):

Column	Purpose
ISBN	Required by NYT
QTY	Total units sold

Only these 2 fields are required. Other fields (title, pub date, etc.) can be optionally retained for internal use or Slack alert context.

⸻

📲 Phase 4: Slack Integration

Slash commands:
	•	/preorders list → Titles eligible for release
	•	/preorders approve <ISBN> → Triggers release_preorder()
	•	/preorders anomalies → Lists detected anomalies
	•	/preorders export → Manually triggers NYT report export

Slack is used for approval, alerts, and quick queries. In the future, a Web UI may be layered in.

⸻

📤 Phase 5: Exports & Archival
	•	Weekly NYT reports saved as artifacts (CSV)
	•	Releases and presales stored in DB
	•	Optional: JSON backups for full audit (/output/)
	•	GitHub commits no longer used for core logic/state

⸻

🔁 Data Consistency Rules
	•	ISBN is the unique key and is enforced across all tables
	•	Preorders must be synced before analyzing or releasing
	•	Presales must reference a valid preorder ISBN
	•	Releases are single events—immutable after snapshot
	•	NYT exports are append-only
