"KIT-84","Kitchenartsandletters","Add Logic to Detect Early Releases","**‚úÖ Business Logic Summary**

* Some preorder books arrive early but should **not** be released prematurely in the report.
* They should continue accumulating presale + post-inventory sales until their official release week.
* These should **not** be approved for early release but should be **tracked and flagged** as special exceptions.

**üß© Expanded GitHub Issue Structure**

**1. üì¶¬†Approved Preorder Titles for This Week**

* Approval checkboxes
* Title, ISBN
* Presold QTY
* Current Inventory QTY
* Pub Date
* Whether it‚Äôs still:
  * Tagged 'preorder'
  * In the preorder collection

**2. üîú¬†Preorder Titles Releasing Next Week**

* Same display format, no approval checkboxes
* Highlight as *‚ÄúUpcoming for Next Week‚Äù*

**3. üö®¬†Early Arrival Exceptions**

### ¬†**(üîñ¬†suggested name: ‚ÄúEarly Stock Arrivals‚Äù)**

* These cannot be approved
* Key data:
  * Title, ISBN
  * Presold QTY
  * Current Inventory QTY
  * Pub Date
  * Status: still tagged 'preorder', in collection, both, or neither
* Exception reason (e.g., positive inventory, missing preorder tag, etc.)

### **4. ‚ö†Ô∏è¬†Other Data Anomalies**

* As you‚Äôve already implemented:
  * Past pub dates
  * Missing pub dates
  * Malformed dates

**5. üìä¬†All Preorders (League Table)**

* Sorted table of all known preorder titles
* Columns: ISBN, Title, Presold QTY, Inventory, Pub Date, preorder tag status, collection status
* Can be used to verify weekly positioning, cumulative tracking, or deeper insights

**üõ†Ô∏è Task Breakdown**

**üìç Phase 1: Categorization Logic (in¬†audit_publication_dates.py)**

* Track **preorders due next week** based on pub_date
* Track **early arrivals**:
  * Positive inventory
  * Future pub_date
  * But not to be approved
* Track **tag/collection status** and include in metadata
* Return flags and group membership in the JSON (e.g., ""group"": ""early_arrival"")

**üìç Phase 2: GitHub Issue Update (in¬†combined-workflow.yml)**

* Expand markdown structure with sections 1‚Äì4
* Display new columns (presold, inventory, pub date, tag/collection status)
* Add summary descriptions above each section

**üìç Phase 3: Test Mode Simulation**

* Inject test data for:
  * A normal preorder
  * A next-week preorder
  * An early arrival
  * One malformed pub date
* Trigger the identify-preorders workflow
* Validate GitHub issue display","Backlog",,"No priority","20e56dc9-274b-455b-8858-ef57d5b67af9","NYT_weekly_and_preorder_release","gil@kitchenartsandletters.com",,"",,,,,"2025-04-21T18:34:03.575Z","2025-04-22T02:40:12.487Z",,,,,,,,"",,,
